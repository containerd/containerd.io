# Containerd website

The containerd website at https://containerd.io is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and published to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

To develop the site locally in "watch" mode will require a recent
release of [`hugo`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases):

```bash
$ make develop
```

You can then open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to see the rendered site. The site auto-refreshes when you modify files locally.
